# Sentiment-Aware Transformer Framework for EEG-Based Emotion and Cognitive Load Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of our **Sentiment-Aware Transformer Network (SATN)** framework for emotion and cognitive load analysis based on EEG signals. This work is part of our methodological study titled:

**"A Sentiment-Aware Transformer Framework for EEG-Based Emotion and Cognitive Load Analysis: A Methodological Study"**

The framework is designed to advance the analysis of athletes' emotional states and cognitive load during competitive environments by integrating EEG-based modeling with advanced sentiment-aware techniques.

## Features

✅ Real-time emotion and cognitive load tracking based on EEG signals  
✅ Sentiment-Aware Transformer Network (SATN) for capturing complex emotional dynamics  
✅ Emotion-Driven Optimization (EDO) for dynamic sentiment weighting and domain-specific transfer learning  
✅ Context-aware error correction to improve robustness and interpretability  
✅ Validated on publicly available EEG datasets relevant to emotion and cognitive state analysis  
✅ Designed for application in sports and competitive environments

## Motivation

Understanding athletes' emotions and cognitive load is critical for optimizing training, mental resilience, and performance in team sports. Traditional methods relying on self-reports or observations are often subjective and lack real-time granularity.

Our proposed SATN framework addresses these limitations by leveraging EEG signals and sentiment-aware deep learning techniques to provide continuous, objective, and high-resolution state tracking.
